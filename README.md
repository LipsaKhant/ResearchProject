# Assessing the Impact of Preprocessing Techniques in Sentiment Analysis

Twitter, one of the most popular microblog,
collects a plethora of interesting data in the form
of brief text posted by users. The data can provide
important information about opinions and sentiments
of the users. Human verification of millions posts
coming from worldwide can be a difficult task. The
better way of understanding this data is classification
based on sentiments. Sentiment analysis is a tool that analyses text and classifies the emotion. Processing very large data and informal language
need a specific preprocessing technique that simplifies
their interpretation and analysis. Therefore, data preprocessing is
an important step in sentiment analysis, as choosing
the right preprocessing methods will increase the
correctly classified classes. In this study, I have assessed
how a particular preprocessing technique affect the
performance of several machine learning models such as
Na¨ıve Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random
Forest and Logistic Regression for sentiment analysis.

## Installation

I have implemented this code in google colaboratory. To run this program, you can download the .ipynb file. 
Open it into the google colaboratory. No further action required! 
    
## Usage

To check which preprocessing technique gives better results for sentiment analysis using Machine Learning Models such as Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest and Logistic Regression.

## Project Flow

- Import Dataset
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Extract Important Features
- Train Models Using Processed Data
- Predict Using Test Data and Analyze/Compare Models

## Instruction to implement
- Download the python Notbook
- Download Data set
- Run the cells in Notebook one by one to obtain results
- For Lemmatization, skip Stemming steps.

## Support

For any Support needed, Email [me](lkhant@lakeheadu.ca).
## Roadmap

- Make custom dataset and perform experiments on it
- Improve Model accuracy using different models.
- I will look forward to build GUI for this project

  
## Project Status

This project is not completed yet, some modificat are needed. Also I will try to implement Deep Learning models to get better accuracies for the real-time experiments.
